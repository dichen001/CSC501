<h2 align="center">CSC501 Fall 2015</h2>
<h2 align="center">PA1: Process Scheduling</h2>
<h2 align="center">Due: September 24 2015, 04:00 AM</h2>

<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of this lab are to get familiar with the concepts
   of process management like process priorities, scheduling, and
   context switching.
</p>

<h2>2. Readings</h2>
<p>The XINU source code (in sys/), especially those related to
   process creation (create.c), scheduling (resched.c, resume.c, and
   suspend.c), termination (kill.c), priority change (chprio.c), as
   well as other related utility programs (e.g., ready.c) and system
   initialization code (initialize.c).
</p>

<h2>3. What to do</h2>
<p>You will also be using the <tt>csc501-lab0.tgz</tt> you have
   downloaded and compiled by following	the
   <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA0/pa0.html">lab	setup guide</a>
   in PA0,
   but you need to rename the whole directory to csc501-lab1.
</p>

<p>In this lab you will implement two new scheduling policies that
   will avoid <i>starvation</i>. At the end of this
   lab you will be able to explain the advantages and disadvantages
   of the two	new scheduling policies.
</p>

<p>The default scheduler in XINU will schedule the process with the highest priority.
   Starvation occurs in XINU when there are two or more processes
   eligible for execution that have different priorities. The higher
   priority process gets to execute first which may result in lower
   priority processes never getting any CPU time unless the higher
   priority process ends.
</p>

<p>The two scheduling policies that you need to implement, as described below,
   should address this problem. Note that for each of them, you need to
   consider how to handle the <font face="Courier New">NULL</font> process,
   so that the <font face="Courier New">NULL</font> process is
   selected to run when and only when there are no other ready processes.
</p>

<p>For the Linux-like scheduling policy, a valid process priority value is an
   integer between 0 to 99, where 99 is the highest priority.
</p>

<h3>1) Linux-like Scheduler (based loosely	on the 2.2 Linux kernel)</h3>
<p>This scheduling algorithm tries to loosely emulate the Linux scheduler in 2.2 kernel.
   In this assignment, we consider all the processes "conventional processes"
   and uses the policies of the <font face="Courier New">SCHED_OTHER</font>
   scheduling class within 2.2 kernel. With
   this algorithm, the CPU time is divided into <i>epochs</i>. In each epoch, every
   process has a specified time quantum, whose duration is computed at
   the beginning of the epoch. An epoch will end when
   all the <b>runnable</b> processes have used up their quantum. If a process has used
   up its quantum, it will not be scheduled until the next epoch starts,
   but a process can be selected many times during the epoch if it has
   not used up its quantum.
</p>

<p>When a new epoch starts, the scheduler will recalculate the time
   quantum of <b>all</b> processes (including blocked ones). This way, a
   blocked process will start in the epoch when it becomes runnable
   again. New processes created in the middle of an epoch will wait till
   the next epoch. For a process that has never executed or has
   exhausted its time quantum in the previous epoch, its new quantum
   value is set to its process priority (i.e., <font face="Courier New">quantum = priority</font>). A
   quantum of 10 allows a process to execute for 10 ticks (10 timer
   interrupts) within an epoch. For a process that did not get to use up
   its previously assigned quantum, we allow part of the unused quantum
   to be carried over to the new epoch. Suppose for each process, a
   variable <font face="Courier New">counter</font>
   describes how many ticks are left from its quantum, then at the
   beginning of the next epoch, <font face="Courier New">quantum = floor(counter/2) + priority</font>.
   For example, a counter of 5 and a priority of 10 will produce a new quantum value of 12.
	</p>

<p>During each epoch, runnable processes are scheduled according to their <i>goodness</i>.
   For processes that have used up their quantum, their goodness value
   is 0. For other runnable processes, their goodness value is set
   considering both their priority and the amount of quantum allocation	left:
   <font face="Courier New">goodness = counter + priority</font>.
   Again, round-robin is used among processes with equal goodness.
</p>

<p>The priority can be changed by explicitly specifying the priority of the	process during the
   <font face="Courier New">create()</font> system
   call or through the <font face="Courier New">chprio()</font> function.
   Priority changes made in the middle of an epoch, however, will only
   take effect in the next epoch.
</p>

<p>An example of how processes should be scheduled under this scheduler is as follows:</p>

<p>If there are processes P1,P2,P3 with priority 10,20,15 then the epoch would be
   equal to 10+20+15=45 and the possible schedule (with quantum duration
   specified in the braces) can be: P2(20), P3(15),	P1(10), P2(20), P3(15), P1(10), but not: P2(20), P3(15), P2(20),
	 P1(10).
</p>

<p>If you use <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA1/testmain.c">testmain.c</a> as your main.c program. You
		are expected to get some results similar to the following:
	<br>
	<br>
	<small><span style="font-style: italic;">
	MCCCCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBMMACCCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBMMMA<br>
	CCCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBMMMACCCCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBMMMB<br>
	BBBBBBMMABBBBBBBMMMABBBBBBBMMMBMMMAMMAMMMMMMAMM<br>
	MAMMMMMAMMMAMMMMMMAMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	</span></small>
	<br>
</p>
<h3>2) Multiqueue</h3>

<p>This scheduler is similar to the scheduler in part 1, except that
   it supports two queues: a Real-Time queue and a Normal queue. </p>

<p>You need to add to XINU a modified version of the <font face="Courier New">create()</font>
function; name the new function <font face="Courier New">createReal()</font>, which
does the same work as <font face="Courier New">create()</font> does, except that the processes it creates are
considered as Real-Time processes. Processes created by the original <font face="Courier New">create()</font>
function are considered as Normal processes. Real-Time processes go into the
Real-Time queue and Normal processes go into the normal queue. </p>

<p>At the start of an epoch, the scheduler generates a random number
to decide which queue to schedule in this epoch. It should ensure that in 70%
time, the real-time queue is selected and in 30% time, the normal queue is
selected. </p>

<p>For processes in the Real-Time queue, the scheduling is round robin.
Each process gets a 100-tick quantum. When all runnable processes run up their
quantum, the epoch ends. </p>

<p>For processes in the Normal queue, the scheduling algorithm is the
same as in part 1. </p>

<p>If a queue is selected but it contains no runnable processes, the scheduler
automatically selects the other queue. Again, the <font face="Courier New">NULL</font> process is selected to run when and only when there are no other ready processes in both queues.</p>

<p>Processes created by default (e.g., the master process) are Normal
processes.</p>

<h3>4. Other implementation details:</h3>
1. <font face="Courier New">void setschedclass(int sched_class)</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function should change the scheduling type to
		either of the supplied <font face="Courier New">LINUXSCHED</font> or <font face="Courier New">MULTIQSCHED</font>.<br>
	<br>
2. <font face="Courier New">int getschedclass()</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function should return the scheduling class
		which should be either <font face="Courier New">LINUXSCHED</font> or <font face="Courier New">MULTIQSCHED</font>.<br>
	<br>
3. Each of the
		scheduling class should be defined as constants<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<font face="Courier New">#define LINUXSCHED 1</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<font face="Courier New">#define MULTIQSCHED 2</font>
	<br>
	<br>
4. Some of source
		files of interest are: create.c, resched.c, resume.c, suspend.c,
		ready.c, proc.h, kernel.h etc.
	<br>
